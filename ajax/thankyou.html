    <blockquote>Thank you for volunteering for the beta test. Beta testing is important, and the problems you find will be fixed before the site is released for the game. Please try your hardest to find errors, glitches, bugs, and just about anything that isn't "just right." Our job will be to look at those problems and fix them to the best of our ability.<br />
    In the bar at the top right of the screen, we have placed a <a href="feedback.php">Feedback</a> button. You can use this to send us problems, requests, or just to say hi. We will read everything that is posted.<br />
    <br />Please register a new account. Your hvzid number should stay the same from what it was before. If it doesn't, please tell us.</blockquote>
